# NewsFeed

The architecture pattern used is MVVM. I have implemented the logic to call a news feed API and display the list of articles. Users can navigate to a details page for each article. Additionally, I've created a filter functionality based on categories. The app also supports bookmarking articles, allowing users to add or remove bookmarks. Bookmarked articles are displayed in the BookmarkView, where users can manage their saved articles.
