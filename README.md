# NewsFeed

The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern. Using SwiftUI, 
Iâ€™ve implemented functionality to call a news feed API, retrieve articles, and display them in a list. 
Users can tap on any article to navigate to a detail page. 
I've also added a filtering feature, allowing users to filter articles based on categories.
Additionally, users can bookmark articles. Bookmarked items are saved and listed in a BookmarkView, where they can add or remove bookmarks as needed.

*** Implemented unit tests to ensure code reliability ***
